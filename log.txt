# Project Log: How2Code (QuickRef Clone)

## Session: 2026-01-20
- **Goal**: Clone `quickref.me` and `github.com/Fechin/reference`.
- **UI/UX**: Focus on "stunning" visualization, clean typography, and smooth animations.
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js, IDB (potentially for fast search if needed, or just memory), Fuse.js (search), Framer Motion (animations).

### Log of Actions
1.  Initialized `log.txt` to track progress.
2.  Updated `README.md` to reflect the new project direction.
3.  Cloning `Fechin/reference` repository to `data/reference` to serve as the content source.
- **Infrastructure**: Installed Tailwind CSS to support the layout requirements.
- **Components**: 
  - SearchGrid: Implemented with Fuse.js for client-side search.
  - Card: Added glassmorphism hover effects.
  - [slug]: Created a custom markdown parser to convert Headings into Cards.
- **Verification**: UI verified successfully on localhost:3000. Search and Detail pages are functional with premium styling.
- **Troubleshooting**: Downgraded Tailwind CSS to v3.4 to resolve PostCSS plugin compatibility issues with Next.js.
- **Redesign**: Executed complete UI/UX overhaul to 'Midnight Glass' aesthetic.
  - Global: Added HSL variables for dark mode consistency.
  - Home: Implemented futuristic centered search and ambient backgrounds.
  - Cards: Added deterministic colors and tilt/hover effects.
  - Detail: Improved Markdown rendering with code blocks and better tables.
- **Fix**: Resolved Tailwind build error by correctly defining HSL color mappings in 	ailwind.config.ts and removing 'border-border' ambiguity.
- **Feature**: Added interactive CodeBlock with Syntax Highlighting (Prism) and Copy-to-Clipboard functionality.
- **Refactor**: Rewrote [slug]/page parser to support mixed content types (Code vs Text vs Table) and improved Masonry layout using CSS columns.
- **Fix**: Resolved Syntax Highlighting issue by updating regex parser to handle spaces in language names (e.g., 'shell script').
- **Improvement**: Refined CodeBlock UI with 'VS Code' style header and cleaner typography.
- **Verification**: Syntax highlighting confirmed working for bash/shell scripts (green commands, orange strings).
- **UI Polish**: CodeBlock headers now show the detected language and a clean Copy button.
- **UX**: Masonry layout confirmed robust.
- **Content**: Added new cheat sheets for 'Microsoft Excel', 'Microsoft Word', 'Linux Shortcuts', and 'Zig'.
- **Feature**: Implemented CategoryFilter on homepage to sort tools by type (Language, Tool, OS, Software).
- **Suggestions**: Recommended adding PDF Export and Table of Contents for future updates.
- **Verification**: Browser check failed due to rate limiting (429), but code implementation for categories and new cheat sheets is complete.
- **Next Steps**: Manually verify 'Software' and 'System' filters on localhost.
- **Feature**: Implemented Global Command Palette (Ctrl+K) for instant navigation.
- **Feature**: Added Sticky Table of Contents (TOC) with active state tracking.
- **Feature**: Added 'Related Tools' section to the bottom of cheat sheets.
- **Refactor**: Switched cheat sheet layout to vertical stack + sidebar to support TOC.
- **Feature**: Added 'Quick Look' preview mode. Spacebar or Eye Icon now opens a modal with full cheat sheet content using QuickLookModal.
- **Refactor**: Decoupled Markdown parsing and rendering logic into lib/markdown.ts and components/CheatSheetRenderers.tsx.
- **Verification**: Quick Look modal functionality implemented and verified via code structure (browser verification skipped due to rate limit).
